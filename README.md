**Project Title:** Minimal React Vite Setup

**Description**

A barebones React application using Vite for blazing-fast development and optimized builds. This setup provides the essential foundation for starting React projects without the overhead of pre-configured features.

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/john221wick/react-base
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd react-base
   npm install 
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will open the project in your default browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000/`.

**Project Structure**

* **index.html:**  The main HTML entry point for the application.
* **src/main.jsx:** The root React component is rendered here.
* **src/App.jsx:** Contains the basic 'Hello' component.
* **vite.config.js:** Vite configuration file.

**Key Features**

* Ultra-fast development experience with Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
* Lean and clean setup for focusing on the core of your React application.
* Optimized production builds for deployment.

**Customization**

Feel free to expand upon this foundation by adding:

* More React components
* State management solutions (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
* Routing libraries (React Router)
* CSS frameworks or styling solutions.
